This is my repository for scripts I make with wizwalker(probably won't be too many)
I've only got my level 5 script right now so to use it:


You put all your accounts in the accounts.txt file(format: username:password), the config is already set all you have to make sure is that there are no other wizards currently on your account it must be an empty account, you need both wizwalker and wizsprinter installed.
