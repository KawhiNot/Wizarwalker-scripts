This is my repository for scripts I make with wizwalker(probably won't be too many)
I've only got my level 5 script right now so to use it:

You need to put all your accounts in the accounts.txt file(format: username:password), the config is already set all you have to make sure is that there are no other wizards currently on your account it must be an empty account, you need both wizwalker and wizsprinter installed.

Also make sure to create your accounts with this link: https://www.wizard101.com/home2/game/page_8ad6a4041a53806e011a54a998d7002c as the bot will work with that link only.

Check out the wizwalker github https://github.com/StarrFox/wizwalker

Made a command centre bot that farms synthonium in The Heap in Lemuria, have p1 at the sigil and start the script, the rest of the clients will port in.
